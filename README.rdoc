=DESCRIPTION:

This is a recipe for installing easily and testing magento and magentoerpconnect.

You should not use this recipe for production, it is just a basic recipe for testing.

If you want to use Magento on chrome or safari, you need to apply this patch

(sorry magento is a bugged software :p)
